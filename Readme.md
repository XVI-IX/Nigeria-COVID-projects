# Project Overview
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, and it has affected major parts of the world. Nigeria, a West-African country, has also been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic after recording its first case on 27th February 2020.

Nigeria is a country with 37 states - Federal Capital Territory included- and a fast-growing economic environment with about 200 million citizens. COVID-19 has affected several country activities as the country steadily progressed from its first case to shutting down major airports, state-wide lockdown, curfews, and reviving its economy.

## Data Collection
Obtained data from various sources including the NCDC website
(https://covid19.ncdc.gov.ng/), the John Hopkins data repository and others.
The web scraping was performed using the BeautifulSoup module.

## Data Cleaning 
* Converted data to their respective appropriate data types
* Renamed the columns of scraped data
* Removed commas (,) from the numerical data.
* Extracted daily data for Nigeria from the Global daily cases data 

## Analysis and Visualization
* Generated a plot that shows the Top 10 states in terms of Confirmed Covid Cases by laboratory test
* Generated a plot that shows the Top 10 states in terms of discharged covid cases
* Plotted the top 10 death cases
* Generated a line plot for the total daily confirmed, recovered and death cases in Nigeria
* Determined the daily infection rate and generated a line plot for it.
* Investigated the relationship between the external dataset and the NCDC Covid-19 dataset.
